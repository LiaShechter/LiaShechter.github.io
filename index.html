								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Lia Shechter, and I grew up on Long Island, New York to an Israeli family. As a result, I grew up speaking Hebrew at home and English outside and was lucky enough to be able to visit my family once a year in Israel.</p>
								<p>For the last three years I have attended college at Northeastern University, studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science while persuing my long standing curiosity about the brain with a minor in Psychology. I have already learned so much over the last three years and was able to complete several projects, some of which are featured <a href="#school"> here</a>.</p>
								<p>In this time, I also had the opportunity to complete two 5-month co-ops. I completed my first co-op as a Security Engineer at an e-commerce company called Rue Gilt Groupe based in Boston, and my second as a Software Engineer at a robotics startup called RoboDeck in Israel. Read about my experiences <a href="#work"> here</a>.</p>
								<p>While I love everything I'm learning in school, my hobbies outside of school and work are just as important to me. Music is a particular love of mine, so I grew up playing piano, flute, guitar, and of course going to as many concerts and music festivals as I could. I also love to read, travel, and make things. Check out my <a href="#play">personal projects</a>.</p></p>

								<h3 class="major">Robodeck</h3>
								<p>RoboDeck is a small startup based in Hod HaSharon, Israel, working to create autonomous robots that simultaniously clean and stain decks. The robot still in the developmental phase and is not yet autonomous, and is thus currently being sold as a deck maintenance service to businesses with large decks across Israel, one of its clients being the city of Tel Aviv who has requested maintenance on its four-kilometer long boardwalk. I interned at Robodeck for about 5 months from January 2023 to June 2023 as a Software Engineer. At Robodeck, I was one of 7 employees, and the only programmer for the robot besides my boss, the CTO. I worked on several projects for the robot, expanded on below.</p>

								<h4 class="major">Jetson nano</h4>
								<p>The biggest project I completed at Robodeck was incorporating a single board computer into the robot. When I arrived, all of the robot's functions were programmed onto the main board, and thus could not be controlled wirelessly in real time. I first introduced a Jetson Xavier into the robot, and then switched to a Jetson Nano to save on costs, size, and power. I configured the computer and wrote several scripts to start the company off on its wireless journey. The main feature I worked on incorporating along with the Jetson was allowing the robot to detect and follow walls and avoid obstacles using a LIDAR sensor, elaborated on below.</p>
								<h4 class="major">LIDAR</h4>
								<p>The next project I worked on after the Jetson was introduced was incorporating a LIDAR sensor into the robot. The LIDAR was placed on the top center of the robot, and I wrote several scripts to read and analyze the LIDAR data by creating regressions on the surrounding objects and making decisions based on a new state machine. On my last weeks at RoboDeck, I began to use the LIDAR and odometry data to create a real-time map of the robot's surroundings in order to allow it to more accurately navigate its environment.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Learning Module</h4>
								<p>The first project I completed at RoboDeck was to create new methods for traversing the deck. The code when I arrived was quite simple, as the robot followed a gap on the deck, rotated 90 degrees, continued straight for a predetermined distance, and spun 90 degrees again to follow the next gap. I created new methods that collected the data on the board and gap widths as the robot traversed, and performed calculations that it used to determine how much to spin how far forward to continue, how far backwards to return, and where to find the next gap. This resulted in a much more accurate traversal and higher success rate, and allowed me to easily expand this algorithm to work with different board-size deck, as the robot was previously only able to traverse 14cm board decks. During my time at RoboDeck, the company incorporated my new methods and expanded their client base, now free of the board size restriction.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Israel Robotics Meetup</h4>
								<p>I had the opportunity to speak at a meetup organized by Israel Robotics about the architecture we chose for the robot. I explained our decisions about how to split functionality between the embedded code on the main board and the single board computer, our challenges with the approach, and our consideratios for the future.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Rue Gilt Groupe</h3>
								<p>Rue Gilt Groupe is a midsized e-commerce company based in Boston, MA. The company had just started a Security team when I joined it in January 2022 as a Security Engineer. The main tasks of the team was to build new internal and external security processes for the company and implement them.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ruegiltlogo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">Risky Events</h4>
								<p>The security team used several different software platforms to monitor risky events and security incidents. One job I had as a member of the team was to aid in the selection of these platforms, learn how to use them, and eventually utilize them as part of my daily routine to monitor potential security incidents. I implemented a procedure within the team for using the software we selected to detect and handle risky events to avoid them turning into escurity breahches.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Compliance</h4>
								<p>As the company was preparing to go public, the security team was responsible for making sure the company was in compliance with all SEC regulations. To aid with this goal, I wrote new runbooks that contained instructions for how certain security incidents should be responded to. I completed these runbooks for ransomware, phishing, and Endpoint Protection incidents. I also vetted all vendors the company requested to work with, and created a security metrics matrix to establish our new security practices, monitor their progress, assign tasks, and highlight which tasks were required to be attended to more urgently.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Blocking devices</h4>
								<p>Part of my job included monitoring the internal devices of the company and blocking access to necessary devices either when there was a risky event, or simply when an employee was terminated. This included going back several years to block access to past employees that had been overlooked because of the lack of a security team. Eventually, I aided with a project to block all USB drives' access to company assets, except for those specifically granted access for what they were needed for.</p>

								<p>I have recently completed my third year at Northeastern University. During this time, I have been able to complete several projects for my classes, some shown below.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Photo Editor</h3>
								<p>The final project for my class "Object Oriented Design" was to make a photo editor in Java. In this project, I worked on perfecting skills such as object oriented programming, MVC design, GUI (JFrame), and JUnit testing. The features of the photo editor included blur, brighten, downscale, flip, grayscale, sepia, and sharpen. Next to each photo was shown a histagram of the RBG values of each pixel in the photo. The image processor could be used through the user interface, by command line, or by script. Below is a photo of of the home page and examples of the photo after being blurred, sharpened, brightened, sepia filtered, and flipped.</p>

								<h3 class="major">CPU</h3>
								<p>In the class "Digital Design", our lab classes consisted of configuring a RISCV CPU in SystemVerilog. The CPU contained a an ALU, register file, data memory, instruction decoder, instruction memory, and branching logic. I configured the CPU onto an FPGA to test each component. Below is an image of the final design.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Digital design computer.png" style="width: 450px; height: 300px; float: left; margin: 0px 50px 25px 50px;" /></span>
								<h3 class="major">Games</h3>
								<h4 class="major">Space Invaders</h4>
								<p>Space Invaders is a game  in which the player must eliminate all of the spaceships, shooting at them while moving horizontally back and forth to avoid bullets. The game was programmed in Java in the eclipse IDE using the funworld GUI.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/space invaders picture.png" style="width: 200px; height: 275px; float: left; margin: 0px 170px 25px 160px;" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">Concentration</h4>
								<p>Concentration is a game in which the cards are placed face down in a grid, and the player must detect all of the matching cards by turning over the least amount of cards. Functionality was added to time the player as they are playing, give them a maximum amount of tries, and provide a real-time score. The game was programmed in Java in the eclipse IDE using the funworld GUI.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Concentration picture.png" style="width: 400px; height: 200px; float: left; margin: 0px 60px 25px 60px;" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">Bridgit</h4>
								<p>Bridgit is a two-player game in which each player has a color and they are distributed in a grid style with white space in between as shown in the first photo below. The players take turns changing a white slot into their own color, the goal being to create the first unobstructed path from one side of the grid to the other (player 1 vertically and player 2 horizontally). The game was programmed in Java in the eclipse IDE using the funworld GUI.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Bridgit photo 1.png" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 25px 50px;" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Bridgit photo 2.png" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; float: right; margin: 0px 50px 25px 10px;" /></span>
								<h3 class="major">Mask Dispensor</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/rgprojectdesign.jpeg"  style="width: 450px; height: 300px; float: left; margin: 0px 50px 25px 50px;" /></span>
								<p>This project, while one of my first, was a very fun one to work on. The assignment was to make a rube goldberg machine with seven simple machines that completed a task, and my group and I decided to make one that acts as a touchless mask dispensor (as we were in the height of COVID19). The original plan is shown above and included a the following steps: <br><br> 
									1. Motion detector attached to an arduino uno board triggered a wedge to fall. Two wheels were connected to the arduino board with a motor, and we designed a device to connect the two wheels and hold a wedge in AutoCAD and 3d printed it. The wedge was made from spare pieces of cardboard.<br>
									2. The wedge set a ball in motion, which fell onto one end of a simple hydraulic machine, which pushes up the other end with a force large enough to flip a lever. (In the transition from planning to execution, we decided to forgo the simple hydraulic system due to time and space constraints.)<br> 
									4. The lever flips and drops another ball through a plinko board onto an inclined plane. The plinko board was also designed in AutoCAD and 3D printed <br>
									6. The ball drops into a pulley which pulls up one side of a lever. This mechanism was built from solo cups and string connecting them, which was all held up by spare pvc pipes.<br>
									7. The ball rolls and pushes into another lever. A wheel was used as the ball, and the lever was made from spare pieces of cardboard.<br>
									8. The lever knocks over a series of books, and the final book switches on a fan<br>
									10. The fan blows a miniature boat across a body of water. The boat was made from a plastic food tray, with a wheel on the back to maintain balance and a cardboard flag to hold a stylus.<br>
									11. The stylus attached to the boat turns on an ipad<br>
									12. The light from the ipad triggers a light sensor atached to an arduino uno board, which was programmed to trigger a spiral to spin a specified amount. The spiral was made from wire, and was attached to a wheel that rotated when triggered.<br>
									13. The spiral holds masks, and once it spins a set amount, one mask is dropped through a slot</p>
								<p>This project was a very interesting one to work on, since it allowed me to work on a variety of skills, such as planning and building circuits, programming, CAD, 3D printing, designing and executing a project from scratch with a group, and finding the resources available to us to execute it. While the project came with many challenges, one we had not expected was for half of our group to leave in the middle of the project. Since COVID19 was at its peak, two of the four members of our group had decided to go home for the rest of the semester. This left two of us to complete the project on our own, spending day and night in dorm building common rooms to complete it on time. Below are photos of the final result.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Projects</h2>
								<p>Outside of class I enjoy playing different instruments, reading and travelling. I also, however, enjoy working on projects of my own when I am able to. Below are several examples.</p>
								<h3 class="major">CAD projects</h3>
								<h4 class="major">Fibonacci Clock</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/FibonacciClock.jpeg" style="width: 225px; height: 350px; float: left;" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Fibonacci spiral.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; float: right; margin: 70px 0px 0px 0px" /></span>
								<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
								<p>I made this clock as a gift for my grandfather, who was a physics professor. The body of the clock was designed in solid works, with the spacing of the numbers calculated from the desired size of the hour hand, and was laser engraved. The hour hand was designed in solidworks as well following a fibonacci pattern, and was 3D printed.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Cutting Board</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cutting board.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This cutting board was a gift for my grandmother, fully designed in solidworks and laser cut and engraved. In the center is written a phrase my grandmother often says in hebrew about my grandfather. The flowes on the left side of the circle are the national flowers of Algere, where my grandfather is from, and on the right side are flowers from Romania, where my grandmother is from. The two flowers on the left side of the board are an Iris and a Violet flower, which are the english translation of the names of her two daughers, and the trees on the right side are oak and cedar trees, which are the english translation of the names of her two sons.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Woodworking</h3>
								<h4 class="major">Guitar Stand</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I built a stand for my guitar from pieces of wood I had available to me. The planning process was long, as I wanted to make something original with the constraints of being small, easily portable, and stable. The final design consists of two "L"s (for Lia) that easily slide together and apart. The wood was cut with a jigsaw, sanded with an electric sander, engraved with a wood burner, and stained. The edges were covered with a ribber strip to securely hold the guitar in place.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Planter</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This decorative planter was made using pieces of wood available to me. The wood was cut to the desired dimensions with a handsaw and sanded with an electric sander. Six holes were drilled into it and fit to the correct size, a string was tied around it, and test tubes were placed inside.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Volunteering</h3>
								<h4 class="major">Movement Neuroscience Lab</h4>
								<p>I have volunteered as a research assistant at the Movement Neuroscience Lab (MNL) at Northeastern University for the last three years. I help run experiments and collect and analyze data for several experiments. Some experiments I was involved in include brain mapping using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the effect of an increased heart rate on motor functioning.</p>
								<h4 class="major">Hebrew Senior Life</h4>
								<p>About once a week, I volunteer with senior citizens at Hebrew Senior Life. I help run a music club, in which we listen to the members' favorite songs, talk about them, and sometimes write and play music.</p>
